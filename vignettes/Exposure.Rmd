In **`ramp.xds`**  exposure to infective bites is handled in several steps: 

1. The number of infective bites, per patch, is computed by a function `F_fqZ.` 

2. These bites are allocated to the local human population strata and to visitors according to their *availability,* which returns the daily `EIR` as a vector. Whereas `F_fqz` is a vector of length $n_p$ or `nPatches,`  the EIR is a vector of length $n_h$ or `nStrata.`

3. Total exposure is transformed into a measure of the *local* FoI or AR under a model of environmental heterogeneity.

4. A separate model estimates the *travel* FoI or AR.

5. The *total* FoI is the sum of expected time spent traveling.
