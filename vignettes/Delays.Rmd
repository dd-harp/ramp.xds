In this short vignette, we explain how **`ramp.xds`** computes lagged parameters and terms while solving delay differential equations.

***

This software is designed to solve delay differential equations using `deSolve::dede`. 
Solving delay differential equations requires computing
lagged values of variables, parameters or terms. 
The lagged values of variables can be computed
by `deSolve::lagvalue;` but there was a
need to compute lagged values of parameters
and terms that had been computed outside of the module. 
This presented a design challenge for modular computing. 

The solution was to create *accessory variables* 
and use `deSolve::lagderiv` to internalize computation of any lagged terms. 
For any lagged term $x(t-\tau)$, we create a new variable
$X$ and compute $$\frac{dX}{dt} = x.$$
The variable $X$ is indexed and initialized 
like other dependent variables. 
Lagged values of $x$ are a simple call to `deSolve::lagderiv` for $X.$
We call $X$ an accessory variable, because it is not describe the
state of the system. 


# Example

A model published by Aron and May in 1982 includes terms to describe the dynamics of infected ($Y$) and infectious ($Z$) mosquitoes. It is system of delay differential equations. To write it down, we use a subscript to denote the lagged value of a quantity: example, $Y_\tau = Y(t-\tau).$ The model assumes mosquitoes become infected exactly $\tau$ days after becoming infected: the mosquitoes that became infected $\tau$ time units ago are $f_\tau q_\tau \kappa_\tau (M_\tau - Y_\tau)$ and a fraction has survived $\tau$ days (with probability $e^{-g\tau}$). With time-dependent forcing terms, the dynamics are:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\frac{dY}{dt} &= fq\kappa (M-Y) - g Y \\
\frac{dZ}{dt} &= e^{-g\tau} f_\tau q_\tau \kappa_\tau (M_\tau-Y_\tau) - g Z \\
\end{array}
$$

To implement this, we would need the value of $f_\tau$, $q_\tau$, $\kappa_\tau$ and $M_\tau$ and $Y_\tau.$ In the software implementation $M$ and $Y$ are variables, so we could use `deSolve::lagvalue`, but the value of $\kappa$ is computed and stored in `Transmission`. The values of $f_\tau$ and $q_\tau$ are computed by the adult mosquito module. 

One way to compute the parameters and terms (let’s call it the external design solution for lagged values) is to compute and store the value of lagged terms in the module where they are computed, so `Transmission` would compute and store $\kappa_\tau$ and the adult mosquito module would need to compute and store the values of $f_\tau$ and $q_\tau.$ The need to compute these lagged values would need to be conveyed to dependent modules.  

The internal design solution for lagged values creates an accessory variable $K$ where $dK/dt = fq\kappa (M-Y).$ The variable is indexed in the same way as the other variables, and it is computed in dMYdt just like the other variables. In the function call, `deSolve::lagderiv` is called to retrieve the lagged value which is the lagged derivative of the variable $K$ at time $t-\tau$, or $f_\tau q_\tau \kappa_\tau(M_\tau - Y_\tau).$
