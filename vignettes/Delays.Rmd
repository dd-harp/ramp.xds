This software is designed to handle delay differential equations. 
Solving delay differential equations requires computing
lagged values of variables, parameters or terms. 

The values of variables can be computed
by `deSolve::lagvalue,` but in a modular framework, 
the need to compute 
lagged values of parameters
computed by other modules presented a design
challenge. 

A decision was made to internalize computation of any lagged terms through 
the creation of *accessory variables.* 
For every lagged term $x(t-\tau)$, an accessory variable
$X$ was created such that $$\frac{dX}{dt} = x.$$
The variable $X$ is indexed and initialized like other dependent variables. 
Lagged values of $x$ are a simple call to `deSolve::lagderiv` for $X.$
