## xde 

**`ramp.xds`** includes the standard SEIS model and the delay SEIS model.   The dependent state variables for both models are:

+ $S$ the density of susceptible hosts

+ $E$ the density of exposed hosts who are infected but not yet infectious

+ $I$ the density of infectious hosts

In the basic versions of the model -- without demographic changes -- population density is constant, so $$H = S+E+I.$$

**`ramp.xds`** includes the standard SEIS model and the delay SEIS (SEISd) model.   

### Compartment Model as an ODE

The SEIS model is a human model modified from the SIS model to include the Exposed group of individuals ($E$). It is incorporated within the **'ramp.xds'** with the fulfillment of the generic interface of the human component.

The model has three parameters: 

+ $b$ is the fraction of infective bites that cause an infection;  

+ $\nu$ is the transition rate from exposed to infectious: the duration of the latent period is $1/\nu$ 

+ $r$ is the clearance rate for infections: the average duration of infection in this model is $1/r$ 

These are coupled systems of ordinary differential equations forced by the force of infection, denoted $h(t)$, where $h = F_h(E);$ here, we assume that exposure is Poisson, so we let:  

$$h = bE$$

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - h S + r I \\
\frac{dE}{dt} = h S - \nu E \\
\frac{dI}{dt} = \nu E - r I\\
$$

```{r}
HPop = 1000
MYZo = list(MYZm = 2000/365, f=1, q=1)
Xo = list(b= 0.5, H=HPop)
seis = xds_setup(Xname = "SEIS", MYZname = "trivial", MYZopts = MYZo, Xopts=Xo, HPop=HPop)
seis = xds_solve(seis, 3650, 15)
```

```{r}
unlist(list_Xvars(seis$outputs$last_y, seis, 1)) -> seis_inf
seis_inf
```

This model has the steady state... 
  
$$
\bar E = H \frac {hr}{h(r+\nu) + r \nu} \\
\bar I = H \frac {h\nu}{h(r+\nu) + r \nu} \\
\bar S = H - \bar E - \bar I 
$$

```

```{r}
sum((seis_inf-seis_ss)^2) < 1e-9
```

### Compartment Model as an DDE

In the delay differential equation model, we let $\nu$ denote the duration of the incubation period, and we let $h_\nu = h(t-\nu).$ 

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - h S + r I \\
\frac{dE}{dt} = h S - h_\nu S_\nu \\
\frac{dI}{dt} = h_\nu S_\nu - r I\\
$$
and $H = S+E+I.$  At steady state, $h=h_{v}$, so 

$$
\bar S = \frac{H}{1+h \nu + h/r} \\
\bar E = h \bar S \nu \\ 
\bar I = \frac hr \bar S \\ 
$$

```{r}
SEISd = xds_setup(Xname = "SEISd", MYZname = "trivial", MYZopts = MYZo, Xopts=Xo, HPop=HPop)
SEISd = xds_solve(SEISd, Tmax = 3650, dt=15)
```

```{r}
unlist(list_Xvars(SEISd$outputs$last_y, SEISd, 1))[1:4] -> seisd_inf
seisd_inf
```

```{r}
xde_steady_state_X(1/365, 1000, SEISd$Xpar[[1]]) -> seisd_ss
seisd_ss
```

```{r}
sum((seisd_inf-seisd_ss)^2) < 1e-5
```
