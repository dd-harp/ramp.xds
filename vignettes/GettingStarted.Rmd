**`ramp.xds`** was designed to reduce the costs of building, solving, and analyzing models describing malaria transmission dynamics and control or the dynamics and control of other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. This vignette gives a basic overview of using the software.

## Installation 

To download the R package, run these commands: 

```{r, eval=F}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("dd-harp/ramp.xds")
```

Then load **`ramp.xds`**: 

```{r}
library(ramp.xds)
```

```{r, echo=F}
#devtools::load_all()
```

## Demo

The software is designed to make it easy to build models. 

+ `xds_setup()` returns a fully configured model;

```{r}
model <- xds_setup()
```

+ `xds_solve()` solves a model, parses the outputs, and computes most of the standard terms. 

```{r}
model <- xde_solve(model) 
```

Note that `model` was passed to `xde_solve,` and the return value replaces `model.` Before `xde_solve,` `model$outputs` was an empty list. After solving, the outputs are stored as `model$outputs`: 

```{r}
names(model$outputs)
```

The outputs are:

+ `time` -- are the time points when the values of the dependent variables were evaluated
+ `last_y` -- is the final state 
+ `orbits` -- are the solutions with the variables parsed by name 
+ `terms` -- the dynamical terms describing transmission, including the EIR. 
+ `deout` -- the raw (unparsed) outputs  
+ `bionomics` -- For models with exogenous forcing, `xde_solve` stores the values of mosquito bionomic parameters 

Every time `xde_solve` is called, the outputs are replaced. 

If the user wants to save them for analysis, they must get the values. Functions like `get_EIR()` make it easy to examine or save a set of standard outputs without delving into the details. 

```{r}
head(get_EIR(model), 3)
```
Another set of functions plots the outputs:

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=5}
par(mfrow = c(3,1))
xds_plot_X(model)
xds_plot_PR(model)
xds_plot_EIR(model)
```



## Model Building 

From a design perspective, a Setup interface can't possibly anticipate the needs of every end user. Instead, it has adopted a system for setting up models that is based on the principle of *scaling complexity:* the framework has framed the universe of possible models as a nested, hierarchical set. In some limiting case, a complex model is often *equivalent to* a simpler model. Rather than try to build one big supermodel, the framework envisions the software around *model families* at varying levels of complexity. In its simplest form, each model family represents the state of a single population. In practice, a single population is subdivided into sub-populations: human population strata; adult mosquitoes in patches; and immature mosquitoes in aquatic habitats. 

The concept for scaling complexity in model building was (in some weird sense) how to construct linked sets of models that could serve as a platform to explore the space of all possible models. To make this work, model building is handled in two steps:

* **Basic Setup** is handled by the function `xds_setup().` It's designed to help a user get started with a properly formulated spatial model. 

+ **Advanced Setup** handles exogenous forcing, vector control, and other modes of malaria control,   

Another set of functions has been developed to work with models. See the related vignette [Working with Models.](Working.html)

### Modularity

The framework is designed to support five dynamical components each handling a different process. The five components are organized into three chunks: 

1. The vertebrate host population, denoted $\cal XH$: 

    + human (or host) demography ($\cal H$) including births, deaths, aging and migration;

    + malaria epidemiology ($\cal X$), in the narrow sense; or more generally, the dynamics of infection and immunity in the host population;  

2. The adult mosquito population, denoted $\cal MYZ$: 

    + mosquito ecology ($\cal M$) 

    + mosquito infection dynamics ($\cal Y$) 

3. Aquatic mosquito ecology,  denoted $\cal L$ 

These three chunks are connected by two interfaces. The first two chunks are connected through the rigid interface describing blood feeding and transmission, denoted $\cal B$. The last two chunks are connected through egg laying and emergence, $\cal N, U$.

### Basic Setup  

*For our purposes, **Basic Setup** encompasses the configurable options in `xds_setup().`*

Which model was setup and solved in the demo above? The software supports a modular framework for model building that is highly flexible and extensible. It's capable of building very capable models, but the software embraces a model-building philosophy of starting simple and adding realism or complexity one step at a time. 

The demo model, above, is one version of the Ross-Macdonald model. It illustrates how the software has streamlined the process of building fairly simple models. The following sections describe how to make **`ramp.xds`** build models that are much more complicated and realistic. 


The `xds_setup()` function **`ramp.xds`** has assigned default options for everything. Each model must configure three dynamical components: human epidemiology; adult mosquito ecology and infection dynamics; and aquatic mosquito ecology. Each one of these three dynamical component is configured by specifying a model name (as a string) and options, passed as a named list, to override the defaults for the model: 

+ `Xname` dispatches a model family for parasitic infections and immunity in the human population, called $\cal X.$ The setup default model is `Xname="SIS"` and default parameters for the `SIS` model are defined in `create_Xpar_SIS.` To replace the default values at setup, a named list can be passed as `Xopts = list(...)` and the named values in `Xopts` will be used instead of the defaults.  

+ `MYZname` dispatches a model family for adult mosquito ecology and parasite infection dynamics, $\cal MYZ.$ The setup default model is `MYZname="RM"` and default parameters for the `RM` model are defined in `create_MYZpar_RM.` To replace the default values at setup, a named list can be passed as `MYZopts = list(...)` and the named values in `MYZopts` will be used instead of the defaults.  

+ `Lname` specifies a model family for aquatic mosquito ecology, $\cal L.$  The setup default model is the trivial model `Lname = "trivial"`. It has no variables, but it passes the outputs -- emerging adults -- as a parameter. To replace the default values at setup, a named list can be passed as `Lopts = list(...)` and the values in `Lopts` will be used instead of the defaults.  

Thu function call: 

```{r}
model1 = xds_setup()
```

returns the same values as the function call: 

```{r}
model2 = xds_setup(Xname = "SIS", MYZname = "RM", Lname = "trivial")
```

**Structural Parameters** are also set up during setup. Basic setup makes it possible to handle *spatial dynamics* with *multiple human / host* population strata. Basic setup was developed to ensure that all interfaces are set up properly when there are multiple patches, multiple habitats, multiple population strata, and malaria importation. The framework follows the mathematical formulas and (with small changes) the notation in [Wu SL, *et. al.* 2023]()
    
- **`nPatches`** or $n_p$ is the number of patches in the model. 
    
- **`membership`** is a vector with the identity of patch where each habitat can be found. Setup sets the value of a variable **`nHabitats <- length(membership)`.** One configurable option is **`searchQ`** with the habitat search weights. 
    
- **`HPop`** is a vector with human population density, and **`residence`** is a vector describing the location of the patch where each stratum resides.  Setup checks that `length(HPop) == length(residence)` and sets the value of a variable **`nStrata <- length(residence)`.** It is also possible to configure heterogeneous biting at the command line by passing **`searchH`** 
    
- If `nPatches >1` then 
    
    - a matrix `calK` describing mosquito dispersal among the patches.  
          
    - a matrix `TimeSpent` can be passed to configure human time spent  

To learn more, we suggest taking a look at the [5-3-4 Vignette](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.xds/articles/ex_534.html), a model with 5 aquatic habitats, 3 patches, and 4 human population strata.  

## Advanced Setup 

***NOTE:**  As demos for these advanced options get developed, we will add the links here.* 

**Advanced Setup Options:** During basic setup, most advanced options are not defined. 

- **Exposure** -- Since catch counts data for mosquitoes are usually well-described by a negative binomial distribution, **`ramp.xds`** has implemented a step between the computation of the EIR and the FoI to model *environmental heterogeneity,* based on a probability distribution function describing the number of infective bites per person. By default, `xds_setup` configures a Poisson model, but this can be changed. 

- **Human Demography** -- In basic setup, the human demographic model is the *trivial* model, but it can be configured with births, deaths, and aging.  

- **Travel Malaria** -- In basic setup, travel malaria is set up to model exposure while traveling, but time spent traveling and the travel FoI are set to zero.  

- **Visiting** -- In basic setup, visiting is set up but the availability of visitors is set to zero. 

- **Forcing** -- handles exogenous forcing by setting up the functions that compute *exogenous variables,* including weather and hydrology. 

- **Control** -- handles malaria control and vector control. 

- **Bionomics** -- handles functional responses to exogenous forcing variables and computes a **baseline.**

- **Multiple Vector Species** -- Each vector species has spatial structure, but it is also possible to configure other vector species (or type). 

- **Multiple Host Species** -- Each host species can be stratified, but it is also possible to configure other host species (or types) to make setup and configuration easier.
