The design of **`ramp.xds`** facilitates modeling malaria as a changing baseline that has been modified by control. Most of the functionality is found in the satellite packages, but 
**`ramp.xds`** sets this up by adding *ports* and *junctions.* 

+ a ***port*** in **`ramp.xds`** or one of the satellite package is a structured way of handling a specific part of malaria. Examples include temperature, mosquito resources, mosquito traps, larval source management, bed nets, or habitat dynamics. Each *port* is defined by:

  - a model object 
  
  - functions that set up variables

+ a ***junction*** in **`ramp.xds`** is a function that implements several *ports.* 

The junctions in **`ramp.xds`** get called in a specific order to minimize *conflicts* that could arise. The junctions are all functions that get  implemented in `xds_compute_terms.` They are:

+ **Forcing** - functions to setup variables for weather and hydrology

+ **Health** - functions to setup mass treatment, mass vaccination, and more 

+ **Vector Control** - functions to *distribute* vector control commodities.

+ **Resources** - functions to model availability of mosquito resources, including ports for variables on the blood feeding and egg laying interfaces 

## Forcing 

`Forcing` :: **`ramp.xds`** sets up an empty *junction* handle exogenous forcing by weather and hydrology. Models to implement forcing are in **`ramp.forcing`**

## Vector Control 

`VectorControl` and `VectorControlEffectSizes`:: **`ramp.xds`** sets up an empty *junctions* handle various aspects of vector control.  Models to implement vector control are in **`ramp.control`**

## Health 

`Health`:: **`ramp.xds`** sets up an empty *junctions* to handle various aspects of health systems interventions.  

## Resources 

The ports are: 

+ BloodHosts

+ HabitatDynamics

+ Travel

+ Visitors

+ Traps
+ Sugar
