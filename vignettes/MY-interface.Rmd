The **MY** component was designed to model adult mosquito ecology and infection dynamics. 

This vignette takes a deep dive into the design and structure of the **MY** component. It is useful for anyone who wants to learn more about how the code works.  

## Required Functions 

Each **MY** module includes XX required functions and some optional ones.

Some of these required functions are `S3` class functions in [adult-MY-interface.R](https://github.com/dd-harp/ramp.xds/blob/main/R/adult-MY-interface.R){target="_blank"}. Others are defined for each module. 

One good example is the `SI` module, posted in the `ramp.xds` github repository [human-MY-SI.R](https://github.com/dd-harp/ramp.xds/blob/main/R/human-MY-SIS.R){target="_blank"}. 

The required functions deal with various tasks for model building and solving: constructing the **MY** model object; the dynamics; the parameters; the variables and their initial values; computing terms and standard outputs; and consistency checks. Optional outputs include other metrics; functions to compute steady states; and module specific functions to visualize the outputs. 

Each module is defined by a string, generically called `MYname,` that identifies the module: *e.g.* `SI.` 

### Dynamics 

1. The dynamics are defined by at least one of the following is required, depending on whether the model family is a system of differential equations or a discrete time system:  

    + `dMYdt.MYname` :: differential equations are defined by a function that computes the derivatives. In `ramp.xds` these are encoded in a function called `dMYdt.` The function is set up to be solved by `deSolve::ode` or `deSolve::dede.` 

    + `Update_MYt.MYname` :: discrete time systems are defined by the function that updates the state variables in one time step. In `ramp.xds` these are encoded in a function called `Update_MYt` that  computes and returns the **state variables.** The forms mimic the ones used for differential equations. 

## MY Model Object

Each module has a pair of functions that set up a structured list called the **MY** model object. 
The object is a list that is assigned to a `class` that dispatches the `S3` functions described below.
It is a compound list, where some of the sub-lists are assigned their own `class` that dispatch other `S3` functions. 

2. `make_MY_obj_MYname` :: returns a structured list called an **MY** model object: 

    + bionomic parameter values or bionomic parameter objects. In most models, the value of baseline bionomic parameters are functions of time, or exogenous variables that vary with time.  
   
    + `class(MY_obj)` = `MYname` 
    
    + the indices for the model variables are stored as `MY_obj$ix` 
    
    + the initial values are stored as `MY_obj$inits` 
    
    + anything else that is needed can be configured here 
    
3. `setup_MY_obj.MYname` is a wrapper that calls `make_MY_obj_MYname` and (for the $i^{th}$ species) attaches the object as `xds_obj$MY_obj[[i]]`

### Parameters

4. `change_MY_pars.MYname` changes the values of some parameters. It is designed to be used after setup. New parameter values are passed by name in a list called `options.`

5. `get_MY_pars.MYname` is a utility to inspect the values of the parameters. 

### Variables

Since the **MY** component is one of three, a function sets up the indices for all the variables in a model.

Two other functions use those indices: one pulls the variables from the state variable vector $y$; the other one pulls the variables by name from an output matrix returned by `xds_solve.` 

After pulling, both functions return the variables in by name in a list to make it easy to inspect or use. 

6. `setup_MY_ix.MYname` - is the function that assigns an index to each variable in the model, and stores it as `xds_obj$MY_obj[[i]]$ix.` The indices are returned as a named list.  

7. `get_MY_vars.MYname` - retrieves the value of variables from the state variables vector $y$ at a point in time and returns the values by name in a list; the function gets called by `dMYdt` and by `change_MY_inits` and it can be useful in other contexts. 

8. `parse_MY_orbits.MYname` - this function is like `get_MY_vars` but it parses the matrix of outputs returned by `xds_solve.` 

### Initial Values

A set of functions is sets up or changes the initial values for the state variables.  

9. `make_MY_inits_MYname` - each model must include a function that makes a set of initial values as a named list. This function does not belong to any `S3` class, so it can take any form. The function should supply default initial values for all the variables. These can be overwritten by passing new initial values in `options.`
    
10. `setup_MY_inits.MYname`  - is a wrapper, that gets called by `xds_setup` and that calls `make_MY_inits_MYname.` The setup `options` are passed to overwrite default values. The initial values are stored as `MY_obj$inits.` 

11. `change_MY_inits.MYname` - a utility to change the initial values. 

### Dynamical Terms 

These functions compute dynamical terms -- the outputs passed to an interface.  

12. `F_fqZ.MYname` - 

13. `F_fqM.MYname` - 

14. `F_eggs.MYname` - 

### Standard Outputs

Each module must output a few key quantities: 

15. `F_prevalence.MYname` - compute prevalence 

16. `F_ni.MYname` - compute net infectiousness (NI) for each stratum. If $F_X \rightarrow X$ and $F_H \rightarrow H$, then $F_{ni} \rightarrow X/H.$ The function gets called after solving, and the NI is attached as a term for inspection and visualization.

17. `HTC.MYname` - compute the human transmitting capacity. This is used by functions in **`ramp.work`** that compute threshold conditions.

### Consistency Checks

Some modules in **`ramp.xds`** or **`ramp.library`** have been included for various reasons. Not all of those models are capable of being extended. To help users avoid using models in ways that are not appropriate, we developed two function classes:  

18. `skill_set_MY.MYname` :: describes model capabilities and limitations

19. `check_MY.MYname` :: at the end of `xds_setup` and at the beginning of `xds_solve,` this function gets run to ensure that some quantities have been properly updated, and to see if anything has been added to a model that is not in its skill set.  

## Optional Functions 

The **MY** interface also sets up `S3` classes for some optional functions, but these might not be appropriate for all models. If a function is not in the *skill set* of the module, then the limitation should be noted in the documentation of `skill_set_MY.MYname` with information in the list. 

### Steady States

Methods are defined to compute various steady states under static parameter values.  

+ `steady_state_M.MYname` :: pass the emergence rate of adult mosquitoes and compute steady states for the **M** component. 

+ `steady_state_MY.MYname` :: pass the emergence rate of adult mosquitoes and net infectiousness, and compute the steady states for the **MY** component.

+ `steady_state_Y.MYname` :: pass adult mosquito population density and net infectiousness, and compute the steady states for the **Y** component.

### Visualization 

Functions have been developed to plot the standard terms, but each module can define its own method for plotting: 

+ `xds_plot_MY.MYname` is a wrapper that calls `xds_lines_X` 

+ `xds_lines_MY.MYname` defines a default method for plotting orbits
