The idea of developing modular software to simulate the dynamics and control of mosquito-borne pathogens originated sometime around 2009 at the Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida. It took much longer than anticipated to finish. The supporting concepts have appeared in various publications. Some algorithms trace back to software packages that never launched. In retrospect, a key challenge was blood feeding, but it was not the only one.

Briefly, **`ramp.xds`** and its supporting satellite packages have replaced `MicroMoB,` and `exDE.`  David L Smith developed the prototypes in R, but it was Sean L. Wu who turned them into the first versions of the R-packages. In the case of `MicroMoB`, the software package was develoepd with the help of Sophie Libkind. The name `exDE` was changed first to `ramp.xde,` which gave rise to `ramp.dts,` a discrete-time version of `ramp.xde.`  After a few months, these two merged and were rebranded as `ramp.xds` where development continued. Stable versions of `MicroMoB` and `exDE` were restored to their last stable versions.

The following is a slightly longer and more detailed timeline:

+ Late in 2021, [**`MicroMoB`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/MicroMoB) was developed as a software package to build discrete-time dynamical systems models for the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control of malaria and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The software was born late in 2021. David Smith wrote the first draft of the software. Sean Wu turned it into a software package and added a lot to it, with the help of Sophie Libkind. 

+ Late in 2022, [**`exDE`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/exDE/) was developed as a software package to build and solve continuous-time dynamical systems mdoels for the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control of malaria and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. Once again, it was David Smith wrote the first draft of the software. Sean Wu turned it into a software package.  

+ The first version of `exDE` had been designed to handle non-autonomous systems, but none of those features had been fully implemented. During 2023, new features were added. At some point, `exDE` was rebranded as `ramp.xde`. Among the new features added were: 

    + A major change was implemented in the way `ramp.xde` handled **delay differential equations.** To interalize computation of terms, a new protocol was developed to add dummy variables and use `lagderivs` to internalize computation of any term passed to any module. New algorithms were added to Ross-Macdonald models that compute mosquito survival and dispersal through an incubation period varying in length.  

    + **Inits** -- *initial values,* had been handled in a single list, but the protocol was changed so they are now handled separately, with new functions `get_inits()` and the `S3` families of functions `get_inits_L()` and `get_inits_MYZ()` and `get_inits_X().` A new function `update_inits()` resets the initial values to the last value simulated. The change avoids any issues that migh arise if two different modules used the same variable name.  

    + **Indexing** -- **indices** for variables are now collected in `pars$ix`

    + **Setup** -- Several new functions were added to set up basic models. 

    + **Solving** -- The `S3` function, now called `xds_solve()` was added to solve differential equations of various classes. 

    + **Outputs** -- The `S3` function `parse_deout()` was added to parse the output of `deSolve` and return the orbits in a set of named lists. These lists are attached to `pars$outputs$orbits.` New functions were also written to compute the dynamical terms that connect the major components. 

    + **Demography** -- Functionality was added to handle human demographic changes, including births, deaths, migration, and aging.  

    + **Hosts** -- An overhaul was required to handle multiple vertebrate host or vector species. 

    + **Forcing** -- The models have been reconfigured to model malaria as a *changing baseline* that has been modified by *vector control.* This required changes to the order of functions that implemented various aspects of forcing by weather and other exogenous variables, and to the return values for functions that computed *independent effect sizes*

+ **`ramp.dts`** was born in April, 2024. The goal had always been to bring `MicroMoB` up to the same level of functionality as `exDE` / `ramp.xde` but it suddenly seemed easier to clone `ramp.xde` and replace the functions 

+ **`ramp.xds`** was born when it became clear that **`ramp.xde`** and **`ramp.dts`** had large amounts of overlapping code.
