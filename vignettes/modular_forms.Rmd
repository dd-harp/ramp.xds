A **Modular Form** for disease dynamics is a stylized way of writing the dynamical systems that emphasizes the modular structure of the process. A mathematical framework for building models of malaria dynamics and control (and other mosquito-borne pathogens) was described in [Spatial Dynamics of Malaria Transmission](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010684){target="_blank"}, and the framework was implemented in `ramp.xds.` The forms we describe here rewrite models so that they closely resemble their implementation in `ramp.xds`, which makes it possible to relate written equations and computed code. 

For an extended discussion of modularity, see the closely related vignettes 
[Understanding ramp.xds](Understanding_ramp.xds.html){target="_blank"} and [Generalized Modularity and Extensibility](modularity.html)

## A Standard Form

There is no *standard form* for writing down systems of differential equations: here, *a standard form* 
is any way of writing down a system of equations that does not emphasize the modularity, or *not a modular form.* 

To illustrate the modular form, we start with the *Ross-Macdonald*-style model in Box 1.  

*** 

**Box 1: A Ross-Macdonald Model** 

+ Let the dependent variable $I(t)$ denote the density of infected humans, and the parameter $H$ the density of all humans

+ Let the dependent variable $Y(t)$ denote the density of infected mosquitoes, and the parameter $M$ the density of all mosquitoes 

+ Let $b$ denote the fraction of bites by infective mosquitoes that infect a human, and let $r$ denote the rate that infections clear 

+ Let $c$ denote the fraction of blood meals on infectious humans infect a mosquito, and let $g$ denote the mosquito death rate 

+ Let $f$ denote the overall blood feeding rate, and $q$ the human fraction 

+ Let $\tau$ denote the EIP. 

In this set of equations, we ignore the delay for sporogony, but we count the mortality, so infections occur at the rate $b e^{-g \tau} fqY/H.$ We assume that the daily FoI is linearly proportional to the daily EIR, consistent with a Poisson model for exposure, so $h = bE.$

$$ \begin{array}{rl}
dI/dt &= b e^{-gn}fq \frac YH (H-I) - r I \\
dY/dt &= fq c \frac IH (M-Y) - g Y
\end{array}$$

## ...in Modular Form

We illustrate by writing a Ross-Macdonald model in its modular form (Figure 1). In the modular form, we identify the terms in one equation that depend on the other variable. First, we focus on the equation describing human infection dynamics. We note that it depends on a term involving the variable $Y.$ The term is epidemiologically meaningful -- it is called the force of infection (FoI). We let $h$ denote the FoI:  $$h=b e^{-gn}fq \frac YH,$$ 

and now we can rewrite the equation

$$ 
dI/dt = h H (H-I) - r I
$$

Next, we isolate the equation describing mosquito infection dynamics, we note that it depends on a term that we will call the net infectiousness (NI).  

$$\kappa = c \frac IH$$ 

The term $c I$ is the density of infected humans, weighted by their infectiousness. 

We note that $fq\kappa$ is the FoI for mosquito infections, and now we can rewrite the equation for mosquitoes: 

$$
dY/dt = fq\kappa (M-Y) - g Y
$$

Since we also want to make this model extensible, we want to draw attention to the term $h.$ We note that the number of infective bites, per human, per day  -- called the daily entomological inoculation rate (EIR) -- is

$$E = f q e^{-g\tau} \frac YH $$

We assume that exposure is Poisson distributed: 

$$h = b E$$  

We emphasize that this is the same set

## Computation

To solve these equations, we need to write functions that compute the derivatives. We are using the R package `deSolve.`  A properly formed derivative function implementing the 

```{r}
RMv1 <- function(t, y, pars) {
  with(pars,{
      eir = exp(-g*n)*Y/H
      foi = b*eir
      kappa = c*I/H
      dX = foi*(H-I) - r*I
      dY = a*kappa*(M-Y) - g*Y 
      return(list(dX, dY))
  })
}
```
