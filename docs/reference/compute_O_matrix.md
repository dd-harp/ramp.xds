Compute the egg laying matrices for all the vector species. The matrix
determines how all the eggs laid by adult mosquitoes are apportioned
among larval habitats

## Usage

``` r
compute_O_matrix(xds_obj)
```

## Arguments

- xds_obj:

  an **`xds`** model object

## Value

an **`xds`** model object
