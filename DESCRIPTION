Description: A computational tool to set up, solve, analyze, and visualize dynamical systems models 
             to support research and simulation-based analytics for malaria and other mosquito-borne pathogens. 
             Supported systems currently include ordinary and delay differential equations and discrete time systems. 
             The software implements a mathematical framework described in Wu et al. (2022) <doi:10.1101/2022.11.07.22282044>.
