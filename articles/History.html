<p>The idea of developing modular software to simulate the dynamics and
control of mosquito-borne pathogens originated sometime around 2009 at
the Emerging Pathogens Institute, University of Florida. It took much
longer than anticipated to finish. The supporting concepts have appeared
in various publications. Some algorithms trace back to software packages
that never launched. In retrospect, a key challenge was blood feeding,
but it was not the only one.</p>
<p>Briefly, <strong><code>ramp.xds</code></strong> and its supporting
satellite packages have replaced <code>MicroMoB,</code> and
<code>exDE.</code> David L Smith developed the prototypes in R, but it
was Sean L. Wu who turned them into the first versions of the
R-packages. In the case of <code>MicroMoB</code>, the software package
was develoepd with the help of Sophie Libkind. The name
<code>exDE</code> was changed first to <code>ramp.xde,</code> which gave
rise to <code>ramp.dts,</code> a discrete-time version of
<code>ramp.xde.</code> After a few months, these two merged and were
rebranded as <code>ramp.xds</code> where development continued. Stable
versions of <code>MicroMoB</code> and <code>exDE</code> were restored to
their last stable versions.</p>
<p>The following is a slightly longer and more detailed timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Late in 2021, <a href="https://dd-harp.github.io/MicroMoB" class="external-link"><strong><code>MicroMoB</code></strong></a>
was developed as a software package to build discrete-time dynamical
systems models for the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control
of malaria and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The software was
born late in 2021. David Smith wrote the first draft of the software.
Sean Wu turned it into a software package and added a lot to it, with
the help of Sophie Libkind.</p></li>
<li><p>Late in 2022, <a href="https://dd-harp.github.io/exDE/" class="external-link"><strong><code>exDE</code></strong></a>
was developed as a software package to build and solve continuous-time
dynamical systems mdoels for the epidemiology, transmission dynamics,
and control of malaria and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. Once
again, it was David Smith wrote the first draft of the software. Sean Wu
turned it into a software package.</p></li>
<li>
<p>The first version of <code>exDE</code> had been designed to
handle non-autonomous systems, but none of those features had been fully
implemented. During 2023, new features were added. At some point,
<code>exDE</code> was rebranded as <code>ramp.xde</code>. Among the new
features added were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A major change was implemented in the way <code>ramp.xde</code>
handled <strong>delay differential equations.</strong> To interalize
computation of terms, a new protocol was developed to add dummy
variables and use <code>lagderivs</code> to internalize computation of
any term passed to any module. New algorithms were added to
Ross-Macdonald models that compute mosquito survival and dispersal
through an incubation period varying in length.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inits</strong> – <em>initial values,</em> had been
handled in a single list, but the protocol was changed so they are now
handled separately, with new functions <code><a href="../reference/get_inits.html">get_inits()</a></code> and the
<code>S3</code> families of functions <code>get_inits_L()</code> and
<code>get_inits_MYZ()</code> and <code>get_inits_X().</code> A new
function <code><a href="../reference/update_inits.html">update_inits()</a></code> resets the initial values to the
last value simulated. The change avoids any issues that migh arise if
two different modules used the same variable name.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indexing</strong> – <strong>indices</strong> for
variables are now collected in <code>pars$ix</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Setup</strong> – Several new functions were added to set
up basic models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Solving</strong> – The <code>S3</code> function, now
called <code><a href="../reference/xds_solve.html">xds_solve()</a></code> was added to solve differential
equations of various classes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outputs</strong> – The <code>S3</code> function
<code>parse_deout()</code> was added to parse the output of
<code>deSolve</code> and return the orbits in a set of named lists.
These lists are attached to <code>pars$outputs$orbits.</code> New
functions were also written to compute the dynamical terms that connect
the major components.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demography</strong> – Functionality was added to handle
human demographic changes, including births, deaths, migration, and
aging.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hosts</strong> – An overhaul was required to handle
multiple vertebrate host or vector species.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Forcing</strong> – The models have been reconfigured to
model malaria as a <em>changing baseline</em> that has been modified by
<em>vector control.</em> This required changes to the order of functions
that implemented various aspects of forcing by weather and other
exogenous variables, and to the return values for functions that
computed <em>independent effect sizes</em></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>ramp.dts</code></strong> was born in April, 2024.
The goal had always been to bring <code>MicroMoB</code> up to the same
level of functionality as <code>exDE</code> / <code>ramp.xde</code> but
it suddenly seemed easier to clone <code>ramp.xde</code> and replace the
functions</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>ramp.xds</code></strong> was born when it became
clear that <strong><code>ramp.xde</code></strong> and
<strong><code>ramp.dts</code></strong> had large amounts of overlapping
code.</p></li>
