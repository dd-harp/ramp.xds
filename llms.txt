**`ramp.xds`** is an R software package that supports
**Sim**ulation-**B**ased **A**nalytics
([**SimBA**](https://faculty.washington.edu/smitdave/simba/index.html))
and **R**obust **A**nalytics for **M**alaria **P**olicy
([**RAMP**](https://faculty.washington.edu/smitdave/ramp/index.html)).

## What is RAMP?

Malaria analytics is the systematic analysis of data for decision
support or to guide malaria policies. Simulation-based malaria analytics
is malaria analytics that uses dynamical systems. **RAMP** is short
acronym for a big idea about how to use simulation based analytics to
support iterative malaria analytics and adaptive malaria control.

Malaria involves non-linear interactions among humans, mosquitoes,
parasites, and malaria managers that are constantly changing in response
to control: it is a kind of complex adaptive system. Lewis Hackett
compared malaria to a game of chess:

> …malaria is so moulded and altered by local conditions that it becomes
> a thousand different diseases and epidemiological puzzles. Like chess,
> it is played with a few pieces, but is capable of an infinite variety
> of situations.

In other words, malaria systems are locally peculiar: small differences,
such as the behaviors of local humans and mosquitoes, can affect blood
feeding patterns, transmission, and the responses to control. Malaria
complexity, local peculiarity, and systematic changes in response to
control create enormous needs for policy, but our ability to fill those
needs is limited. Malaria analytics must make the most of limited data.
Malaria research & analytics need a systematic way of dealing with
complexity, local peculariaty, and uncertainty. This was the seed
crystal for RAMP.

RAMP was developed as a way of dealing with the uncertainty. We can’t
wish away the uncertainty, but we can do our best to characterize and
quantify uncertainty and propagate the uncertainty through analytics
pipelines we use to develop policy. Robust analytics have gone to great
lengths to ensure that the advice would not change if the analysis had
been done in another reasonable way.

This software, called **SimBA** (short for **Sim**ulation-**B**ased
**A**nalytics), was developed as a practical way of developing robust,
simulation-based analytics for malaria. Managing malaria involves a
large set of linked activities, and some of these come with a heavy
computational or quantitative load: data processing and curation;
conventional statistical analysis; scenario planning; and strategic
planning. *Simulation based analytics* – the application of dynamical
systems models of malaria transmission dynamics and control in malaria
analytics – play a key role through seamless integration of
retrospective data analysis, real-time decision support, and
evidence-based approaches to setting rational expectations about the
future. SimBA lowers the costs of doing all this robustly.

The [**SimBA**
project](https://faculty.washington.edu/smitdave/simba/index.html)
(**Sim**ultation-**B**ased **A**nalytics) is a suite of software
packages that have the goal of supporting routine malaria analytics:

- It was designed to enable nimble model building.

- The models play a role in developing **malaria intelligence** – a
  quantitative assessment of malaria built for policy evaluation.

- The software was designed for iterative engagement: the models can be
  reused and they can be modified.

- The software was designed for robust analytics; it is comparatively
  easy to build suites of models that cover the uncertainty, and
  functions enable development of analytics pipelines to propagate
  uncertainty.

- The software was designed for accountability; the analysis is
  transparent.

By nimble, we mean a lot of things. One of them is that software lowers
the costs of setting up, solving, analyzing, and applying dynamical
systems to model the mosquito ecology or the epidemiology, spatial
transmission dynamics, and control of malaria and other
mosquito-transmitted pathogens.

A core goal is to understand malaria transmission in terms of a
*changing baseline* (using
[**`ramp.forcing`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.forcing/) to model
the effects of weather, hydrology, …) that is *modified by vector
control* (using
[**`ramp.control`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.control/)).

## What is SimBA?

This package, **`ramp.xds`** handles core computation for a suite of six
software packages that support simulation-based analytics. SimBA
describes the collection.

SimBA includes **`ramp.xds`** and all its satellite packages (below).

SimBA has been designed to serve the needs of malaria programs, where
mathematical models are used for decision support and adaptive malaria
control in a defined geographical area. Mechanistic models that have
been fitted to data describing malaria in a place provide a synthesis of
*malaria intelligence.* These models can facilitate complex analysis,
extending our innate mental capabilities. By characterizing and
quantifying uncertainty, and then propagating the uncertainty through
the analysis, simulation-based analytics serve as a platform for giving
robust policy advice and for adaptive malaria control. As the needs of a
malaria program changes, the models can be modified – simplified or
extended – to serve the tasks at hand.

**`ramp.xds`** does core copmutation: the software makes it easy to
build and solves dynamical systems and outputs the predicted values of
standard, observable malaria metrics. It also provides some
computational support for qualitative analysis: it computes steady
states, stable orbits. In
[**`ramp.work`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.work/), we developed
algorithms that fit models and evaluate vector control; that develope
short term forecasts; and that enable scenario planning and strategic
planning.

Originally, **`ramp.xds`** was a single program, but it made sense to
split the software into several R packages. When it split, we started
using calling the software development project **SimBA**. In the narrow
sense, **SimBA** software includes six distinct R packages:

1.  **`ramp.xds`** handles setup, solving, plotting, and some analysis.
    It was developed to build and solve dynamical systems models for the
    epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and control of malaria and
    other mosquito-transmitted pathogens based on a well-defined
    mathematical framework. It includes a basic set of models – enough
    to design, verify, and demonstrate the basic features of modular
    software.

2.  [**`ramp.library`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.library/) is an
    extended library of models – stable code that has been tested and
    verified. It includes a large set of model families published in
    peer review that are not included in **`ramp.xds`** The ability to
    reuse code reduces the costs of replicating studies. Through this
    library, **`ramp.xds`** also supports nimble model building and
    analytics for other mosquito-borne pathogens.

3.  [**`ramp.control`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.control/) is a
    collection of disease control models for **`ramp.xds`**

4.  [**`ramp.forcing`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.forcing/) is a
    collection of utilities to model exogenous forcing in models for
    **`ramp.xds`**

5.  [**`ramp.demog`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.xds/ramp.demog.md)
    is is a supplementary code library for **`ramp.xds`** that handles
    human demography and stratification, including vital dynamics and
    age structure.

6.  [**`ramp.work`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.work/) includes
    algorithms to apply the framework, include code to fit models to
    data and to do constrained optimization

**`ramp.xds`** is under active development. It supersedes two other
software packages, no longer under active development:
[**`exDE`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/exDE/) and
[**`MicroMoB`**](https://dd-harp.github.io/MicroMoB/). The history of
development of RAMP simulation software has been memorialized in a
[vignette](https://dd-harp.github.io/ramp.xds/articles/History.html).

The material in this website supports **`ramp.xds`** development and a
basic introduction.
