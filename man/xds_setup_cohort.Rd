\description{
A modified version of \link{xds_setup} to setup up studies of cohort
dynamics.

The \strong{\code{xds}} object defines \code{frame = class(frame) = 'cohort'} but there
is no \code{cohort} case for \link{xds_solve}. Instead, cohort
dynamics are studied using \link{xds_solve_cohort}, which was designed
to compare the outcomes for cohorts of different ages when exposure is
changing.

The interface includes options to configure a function
describing \code{F_eir} as a function of time, with seasonal components
and a trend. Exposure in a cohort is a function of its age, including
a function that modifies exposure by age.
