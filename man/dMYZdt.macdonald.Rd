\description{
This implements a delay differential equation model for adult mosquito ecology and
infection dynamics that is consistent with the model published by George
Macdonald in 1952. A generalized version of this model, the \strong{MYZ} module \code{GeRM},
was developed to handle exogenous forcing by weather and vector control. This model
should be used only for educational purposes.

\strong{Variables:}
\itemize{
\item \eqn{M}: the density of adult mosquitoes
\item \eqn{Y}: the density of infected adult mosquitoes
\item \eqn{Z}: the density of infectious adult mosquitoes
}

\strong{Parameters and Terms:}
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\Lambda} or \code{Lambda}: the emergence rate of adult mosquitoes (from \code{F_emerge})
\item \eqn{f} or \code{f}: the blood feeding rate
\item \eqn{q} or \code{q}: maturation rate
\item \eqn{\tau} or \code{eip}: the extrinsic incubation period
\item \eqn{\Omega} or \code{Omega}: an adult mosquito demographic matrix, including mortality and migration
\item \eqn{\Upsilon} or \code{Upsilon}: survival and dispersal through the eip, \eqn{\Upsilon= e^{-\Omega \tau}}
}

\strong{Dynamics:}
In the delay equation, we use the subscript to denote the lagged value of a
variable or term: \emph{e.g.}, \eqn{M_\tau = M(t-\tau)}.

\deqn{
\begin{array}{rl}
dM/dt &= \Lambda - \Omega \cdot M \\
dY/dt &= fq\kappa(M-Y) - \Omega \cdot Y \\
dZ/dt &= \Upsilon \cdot (fq\kappa)_\tau(M_\tau-Y_\tau) - \Omega \cdot Y \\
\end{array}}

This model was included mainly for the historical interest. It has been updated to handle
exogenous forcing by weather and vector control in the module \code{GeRM}
}
\note{
This model is not capable of being extended to
handle exogenous forcing by weather or vector control. Please
use the \code{GeRM} model.
