\title{Compute the egg distribution matrix - \eqn{U}}
\usage{
compute_Umatrix(search_weights, habitat_matrix, Q)
}
\arguments{
\item{search_weights}{the habitat search weights}

\item{habitat_matrix}{the habitat membership matrix}

\item{Q}{the total availability of egg-laying habitats}
}
\value{
a \code{nHabitats} \eqn{\times} \code{nPatches} \link{matrix} describing egg distribution, \eqn{U}
}
\description{
The egg distribution matrix, \eqn{U}, allocates a portion of eggs laid
by adult mosquitoes in each patch to each one of the aquatic habitats in the patch.
}
\details{
The algorithm is motivated by
the notion of mosquito \emph{searching} for aquatic habitat
and a quantity we call \emph{habitat availability}, \eqn{Q}.
Each habitat is assigned a \emph{search weight,} \eqn{\omega}.
In the simplest case, habitat availability is the sum of \eqn{\omega} by patch, which uses
the habitat membership matrix, \eqn{N}. If the habitats in the model got
all the eggs, then \deqn{Q = N \cdot \omega.}
The fraction of eggs in the \eqn{j^{th}} patch laid
in the \eqn{i^{th}} habitat is \eqn{\omega_i / Q_j.}
To make the model extensible, habitat availability sums all the places where
mosquitoes might lay eggs, including ovitraps and unsuitable habitats.
If every element in \eqn{Q} were positive, the egg
distribution matrix  would be:
\deqn{{U} = \mbox{diag}\left(\omega \right) \cdot {N}^T \cdot \mbox{diag} \left(\frac{1}{Q}\right).}
To avoid dividing by zero, the zero elements in \eqn{Q} are set to an arbitrary positive value.

\seealso{
The membership matrix \eqn{N} is computed by \link{create_habitat_matrix}

Total habitat availability, \eqn{\cal Q}, is computed by \link{compute_Q}

The availability of ovitraps and bad habitats is setup in \link{setup_EGG_LAYING}
