\title{Setup the Habitat Interface for Egg Laying and Emergence}
\usage{
setup_ML_interface(xds_obj, membership)
}
\arguments{
\item{xds_obj}{an \strong{\code{xds}} model object}

\item{membership}{is the habitat membership vector}
}
\value{
an \code{xds} object
}
\description{
Set up a part of the \code{xds} object that defines the interface for egg laying
}
\details{
This implements a model for egg laying described by Wu SL, \emph{et al.}, (2023).

Modular computation in \strong{\code{ramp.xds}} requires a rigid interface
to guarantee mathematical consistency for egg laying and emergence.
The interface is defined by an object called \code{ML_interface} that is
attached to the \code{xds} object \code{xds_obj} as \code{xds_obj$ML_interface}.
The interface includes
\itemize{
\item a habitat membership matrix, \eqn{N} made by \link{make_habitat_matrix}
\item the habitat search weights
\item a quantity that is motivated by mosquito searching for resources, called
habitat availability \eqn{Q}, computed by \link{F_Q};
\item the availability of ovitraps
\item the availability of unsuitable habitats
\item the availability of anything that attracts egg laying mosquitoes, including ovitraps and unsuitable habitats
\item the egg distribution matrix \eqn{O}, made by \link{make_O_matrix}
\item a vector that stores eggs laid
}

This function is called by \code{compute_xds_object_template} to set up \code{ML_interface} and the variables and parameters with all
the variables it might depend on.
