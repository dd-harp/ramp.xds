\title{Compute eggs laid, the first time}
\usage{
\method{EggLaying}{setup}(t, y, pars)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{the time}

\item{y}{the state variables}

\item{pars}{an \code{xds} object}
}
\value{
an \code{xds} object
}
\description{
In autonomous models, this function gets called once to set up a variable describing host availability (\eqn{Q}) and
the egg distribution matrix (\eqn{U}).
}
\details{
If conditions are time, invariant,
then \link{EggLaying.static} computes eggs laid. The functions that
compute \eqn{Q} and \eqn{U} are called \emph{once} after setup.
The class of \code{EGGpar} is set to \code{static} and the function
is never called again. If any parameters are changed that would
affect egg laying, then the class of \code{EGGpar} should get reset to \code{setup}
to reconfigure \eqn{Q} and \eqn{U}.
