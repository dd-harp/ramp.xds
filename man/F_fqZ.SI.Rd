\title{Net Blood Feeding by Infectious Mosquitoes - \code{SI} Mosquito Model}
\usage{
\method{F_fqZ}{SI}(t, y, pars, s)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{current simulation time}

\item{y}{state vector}

\item{pars}{a \link{list}}

\item{s}{the species index}
}
\value{
a \link{numeric} vector of length \code{nPatches}
}
\description{
The variable \eqn{Y} is the denSIty of \emph{infected} mosquitoes.
The model blood feeding \strong{parameters} are:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{f} is the overall blood feeding rate
\item \eqn{q} is the human fraction for blood feeding
\item \eqn{\Omega} is the demographic matrix
\item \eqn{\tau} is the EIP
}

The net blood feeding rate by infectious mosquitoes is computed by accounting
for survival and dispersal that would occur in a delay differential equation:
\deqn{\Upsilon = e^{-\Omega \tau}}
so
\deqn{fqZ = fq (\Upsilon \cdot Y)}
The daily EIR for the population strata is \eqn{\beta \cdot fqZ}
}
