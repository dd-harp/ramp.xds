\usage{
setup_EGG_LAYING(pars, membership)
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{an \code{xds} object}

\item{membership}{is the habitat membership vector}
}
\value{
an \code{xds} object
}
\description{
Set up a part of the \code{xds} object that defines the interface for egg laying
}
\details{
This implements a model for egg laying described by Wu SL, \emph{et al.}, (2023).

Modular computation in \strong{\code{ramp.xds}} requires a rigid interface
to guarantee mathematical consistency for egg laying and emergence.
The interface is defined by an object called \code{EGGpar} that is
attached to the \code{xds} object \code{pars} as \code{pars$EGGpar}.
The interface includes
\itemize{
\item a habitat membership matrix, \eqn{N} made by \link{create_habitat_matrix}
\item the habitat search weights
\item a quantity that is motivated by mosquito searching for resources, called
habitat availability \eqn{Q} made by \link{compute_Q};
\item the availability of ovitraps
\item the availability of unsuitable habitats
\item the availability of anything that is like a habitat, but that is an aquatic habitat in the model, including ovitraps and unsuitable habitats, \eqn{Q_{tot}} made by \link{compute_Qtot};
\item the egg distribution matrix \eqn{U}, made by \link{compute_Umatrix}
\item a vector that stores eggs laid
}

This function is called by \code{make_xds_object_template} to set up \code{EGGpar} and the variables and parameters with all
the variables it might depend on.
